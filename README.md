# UnIT 2024 Best-Prague Hackathon
This is a winning solution that was ranked 2. place on the UnIT hackathon organized by the organization [Best Prague](https://bestprague.cz/).

The goal of this competition was to create an interface to be used in integration with robot Pepper. The robot will be capable leading conversation with students, precisely to communicate to students that might be on the fence about deciding which university programme will they enroll in. The result of the student bot interaction is that the robot suggests a programme that best suits the students needs. The robot also needs to account for the students emotional state.
